                <div class="image-text">Dark Matter: Though invisible, dark matter exerts gravitational forces shaping the cosmos. It comprises around 27% of the universe's mass-energy content, yet its nature remains a profound mystery, challenging physicists' understanding of fundamental particles and their interactions.</div>
